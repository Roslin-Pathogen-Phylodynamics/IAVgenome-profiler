Definition of genomic profiles for influenza A viruses

Determining the genetic basis of variation in the epidemiology and ecology of pathogenic viruses is an important challenge in microbiology. Influenza A viruses have a segmented RNA genome. Genome segmentation facilitates the potential for the emergence of novel strains and phenotypes through the process of genomic reassortment, which involves the exchange of gene segments between two (or more) viruses that coinfect the same host cell.

This repository contains information associated with efforts to understand how reassortment has affected the characteristics, fitness and evolutionary trajectories of lineages of clade 2.3.4.4b influenza viruses. Such investigation required the classification of genomes into reassortment profiles or genotypes,

The classification of genomes into profiles involved the definition of phylogenetic clusters for each of the eight genome segments. The combination of eight segment IDs forms a genomic profile.

The methodology developed here and applied to H5Nx clade 2.3.4.4b genomes is described in the preprint Harvey et al. (2025) Genetic reassortment and diversification of host specificity have driven evolutionary trajectories of lineages of panzootic H5N1 influenza. bioRxiv https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.08.20.670882

Our methodology is broadly comparable with existing systems such as that developed to classify genomes sampled in North America (https://github.com/USDA-VS/GenoFLU) or in Europe (https://github.com/izsvenezie-virology/genin2). For a comparison of genotypes profiles assigned here and those attributed by the USDA system, see the directory *H5Nx_2.3.4.4b/v1.2024.12.19/compare_usda_genoFLU*
